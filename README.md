# MangaGenerator
Given a manga volume distributed in one folder for each chapter, this tool group all the images in a single folder in the correct order. This is useful in order to compress the single volume in a cbr or a zip and send it to a kindle for example.

The ask the user for the number of the volume and the folder where the distributed volume is (the last one can be skipped and it will take the current folder).
